### Final Project: Ultrasonic Radar System with Alert Indicators

- Mission College
- CIS-033-53082 Summer 2023

##### Team Members: Will Wang

##### Project Idea:

##### The proposed project is to build an ultrasonic radar system with a servo motor and various alert indicators. The system will detect objects within a specified range and provide both visual and audible warnings. We aim to create a functional prototype with the following features:

1. Servo Motor: We will connect a servo motor to the radar system, enabling it to rotate 360 degrees. This rotation will allow for complete coverage and object detection in all directions.

2. Range Control: We will incorporate a switch that allows us to set the desired range of the radar system. For example, if we set the range to 20 cm, the radar will scan for objects within that distance.

3. Object Detection and Alert System: Using an ultrasonic sensor, we will measure the distance to objects within the set range. If an object is detected, we will trigger an alarm, blink LED lights (preferably red and blue), and display warning messages on an LCD screen. The LED lights will serve as visual indicators, while the alarm and LCD display will provide both audible and visual warnings.

##### Project Deliverables:

##### This project will involve the following deliverables:

1. Hardware Assembly: We will design and assemble the required hardware components, including the Arduino board, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, switch, LED lights, buzzer, and LCD display.

2. Software Development: We will write the necessary code to control the servo motor, interface with the ultrasonic sensor, and activate the alert system based on object detection within the set range. The code will be written in Arduino programming language.

3. Testing and Improvement: We will extensively test the functionality of our ultrasonic radar system, ensuring accurate distance measurements, proper rotation of the servo motor, and reliable object detection. Based on testing results, we will make necessary improvements and refinements to enhance the system's performance.

4. Project Report: We will compile a comprehensive project report that includes an introduction, hardware diagram, software flow chart, detailed explanation of the project, and documentation of testing and improvement processes. Additionally, we will provide conclusions and discuss potential future enhancements.

5. Video Presentation: We will create a short video presentation showcasing our working prototype, demonstrating the rotation of the radar system, object detection, and the activation of alert indicators. The video will also include an overview of the project and its key features.

##### Timeline:

We propose the following timeline for completing our project:

###### Week 1:

1. Research and gather necessary components, finalize hardware and software design.
2. Assemble the hardware components and start coding the software.
3. Complete coding, test individual components, and integrate them into the system.

###### Week 2:

1. Test the complete system, perform improvements, and document the project.
2. Finalize the project report, create the video presentation, and prepare for final submission.

##### This project will provide us with valuable hands-on experience in hardware integration, programming, and problem-solving. It aligns with our interest in exploring practical applications of ultrasonic sensors and Arduino-based systems.
