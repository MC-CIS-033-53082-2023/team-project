### Design and Implementation of an Ultrasonic Radar System With RGB Indicator, Sound Warning and Servo Motor

##### Introduction:

- Problem Definition: Object detection systems have extensive applications in robotics, automation, security, and vehicle navigation. The goal of this project is to develop an interactive and user-friendly object detection system that provides both visual and auditory alerts when an object is detected.
Solution: Our solution is an Arduino-based Ultrasonic Radar System, which uses an ultrasonic sensor for object detection, a servo motor for sensor rotation, an RGB LED for visual warnings, a buzzer for auditory warnings, and an LCD display to show system status and detected object distances.
- Body:
1. Hardware Description: Our hardware components consist of an Arduino UNO, an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, a Servo Motor, an RGB LED, a Buzzer, a 16x2 LCD Display, a Potentiometer, and a Toggle switch. Each of these components plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the system.
2. Hardware Diagram: (A detailed diagram or photo of the assembled hardware would be included here.)
3. Software Flow: Our Arduino code initializes the hardware components and continuously monitors for the presence of objects within a user-specified range. If an object is detected within this range, the system activates the RGB LED and the buzzer to provide alerts. (A flowchart detailing this operation would be included here.)
4. Code Explanation: Our Arduino code uses several key functions to implement the required features of the system. For instance, the run_radar() function is the main function which controls the radar operation. Other functions like warning_blink() and sonar_detect() manage the alert system and object distance detection, respectively.

- Results:

1. We successfully tested the system for various objects at different distances and found that it was able to accurately detect objects and generate appropriate alerts.
Conclusion:

1. Learning: Throughout the project, we developed a comprehensive understanding of Arduino programming, interfacing multiple hardware components, and implementing object detection using an ultrasonic sensor. This project also honed our problem-solving and teamwork skills.
2. Future Work: In the future, this project can be extended by integrating a Wi-Fi module to send alert notifications to a mobile device, enhancing the field of view with additional sensors, or incorporating object tracking functionality.
